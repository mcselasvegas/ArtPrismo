------------------ | ------------------------ |
Acid Etching|This process involves engrossing the metal in an acid solution while protecting certain parts with a substance like wax or rosin, which is known as resist, in order to create a pattern on the metal&rsquo;s surface.|
Acid Test|Acid test determines the purity of gold through the use of nitric acid and aqua regia.|
Actual Gold Content|Actual gold content describes the amount of gold that exists in a metal object after subtracting all the alloys.|
Ag|The chemical symbol for silver.|
Alloy|An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals usually mixed to enhance the strength and/or appearance of a particular metal. Copper, silver, nickel, zinc etc are frequently used as alloy metals and usually are mixed with all precious metals for some specific purpose.|
Alpaca|It is a mixture of alloys, which is a substitute of silver, consisting of 55% copper, 20% nickel, 20% zinc, and 5% tin.|
Aluminum|It is an inexpensive, lightweight and malleable silver-white ore with a bluish tinge. Aluminum is remarkably resisted to oxidation and used in many alloys.|

One carat (ct.) equals 200 milligrams, or 0.2 grams (1/5 of a gram), or 1/142 of an ounce. There are 100 points in a carat. If all other factors are equal, the more a diamond weighs, the more valuable it will be. It is sometimes incorrectly spelled ?Karat?, but Karat refers only to the fineness of pure gold and gold alloys.|

Rhodium Platin|In this process, rhodium is applied through the electroplating process to base metals like gold, sterling silver or some other metal alloy. This rhodium plating gives silver tone finish, which is darker than a silver-plated finish and darkens with time rather than tarnishing like silver plate. Rhodium plating is virtually identical to Platinum but on a fraction of the cost and often it is used on fashion rings and brooches.|

Under this technique, natural sand (lake sand) or green sand (mixture of sand, clay and some water) is packed onto wood or metal pattern halves, removed from the pattern, and metal is poured into resultant cavities. And finally, mold is broken to remove casting. This technique requires a lead-time of days to obtain castings.|
Satin Finish|Satin finish is a texture of a metal surface that is in between matte finish and a brilliant one. In this finish, a series of tiny parallel lines are scratched onto a metal surface with a wire brush or polishing tool to produce texture.

Silver Plating|Silver plating is a method of depositing a silver layer on other metal surface mainly for decorative purposes on household and Jewelry items.|
Soldering|Soldering is a technique, used by jewelers, in making and repairing Jewelry. By using this technique, two or more metal pieces are joined by applying a molten metal or metal alloy that has a lower melting point than the two metals being joined. This molten metal forms a bond when cooled and solidified. Soldering is also used in adding findings or links in a metal piece.|

Swage|Swage is a technique which uses a tool or hammer to bend or shape a metal available in solid state.|
Tarnish|A dull metal finish or luster due to its exposure to air or dirt that discolors the surface of metal as well as due to reaction between metals and other chemicals which discolors the surface, particularly silver which reacts with sulfur. Tarnish is a form of corrosion.|
Tin|A silvery metallic element with a low melting point and resistant to corrosion, which is often used as soldering material and alloy for other precious metals. The chemical symbol for tin is Sn.|

White Metal|White metal, also known as pot metal, is a mixture of alloys which do not contain any precious metal.|
Yellow Gold|Yellow gold is the most frequently seen and a timeless color. It is usually alloyed with silver and copper. Depending on the karat gold (14K, 18K or 22K), the color of yellow gold may vary from a softer shimmering yellow to a bright rich yellow. This is due to the varying alloy combinations. The color contrast of yellow gold is most suitable to diamonds and other delicately colored gemstones, as they can appear brilliant and vivid.|
