<p>Many people may not realize the rich history and interesting symbolism of the bracelet. The Greek word brachile meant "of the arm" and has been modified over time to represent the word we know as bracelet, as well as the Latin word brachium, meaning simply "arm".</p>

<p>There are many types of bracelets, including charm, bangles, beaded, link, slap, and penannular. There are also sports and tennis bracelets. Charm bracelets consist of a gold or silver chain with various charms attached. Bangles are a single ring of metal or plastic worn on the wrist, often with several worn together. Beaded bracelets are often representative of something, with each bead holding its own meaning, while slap bracelets are a fun accessory for the wrist among children and teens. Penannular bracelets do not go all the way around the wrist and are a common modern accessory.</p>

<p>Bracelets became popular as far back as 5000 BCE, in Egypt. There have been bracelets found in Russia that are thought to be over 40,000 years old. Bangles are an important part of some marriage ceremonies throughout the world.

Greek soldiers wore leather bracelets to protect their wrists and it became a traditional part of their military uniform. Bracelets were popular for both men and women until The Middle Ages when they became an accessory worn mainly by women. Bracelets re-emerged as an extremely fashionable accessory for women in the 17th century. During the 20th century, men often began wearing bracelets again, although they were typically more simple and singular, whereas many women wore multiple bracelets of all different styles.</p>
